# Multi-Task-Learning-MTL-Model
This script is an implementation of a Multi-Task Learning Model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection, and Sentiment-Emotion Joint Modeling.

In more specific terms, the model can be referred to as:

    Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) Model: This part of the model focuses on identifying the sentiment towards specific aspects or entities in the text.
    Emotion Detection Model: This part of the model focuses on detecting the emotions expressed in the text.
    Sentiment-Emotion Joint Modeling Component: This component combines the sentiment and emotion detection tasks into a single model, allowing for joint learning and improved performance.

The overall model can be referred to as a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Model, as it learns to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously.

In terms of the specific architecture, the model can be referred to as a LSTM-based MTL Model with Adversarial Training, due to its use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and adversarial training techniques.





📜 Note: This project is still on development so you might face some errors but I am trying to address the errors 🔍 please help if you find some. 


😮‍💨 Errors known: 

1. Missing error handling
2. Lack of hyperparameter tuning
3. Inconsistent evaluation metrics

    These will be fixed soon guys thank you.😁
